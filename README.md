  I was inspired to switch careers to tech because I want to be part of its transformative impact on people's lives by providing tools to make the most of their skills and creativity.
  
  I initially approached the change through self-driven learning, taking part in the online CS50 course from Harvard where I found the technical and theoretical aspects of software engineering very engaging. I built on this with the immersive course at General Assembly which introduced me to the industry standard technologies and gave me a great opportunity to produce interesting, modern projects.
  
  I am now searching for my first role as a developer where I look forward to continuing to learn as much as I can.
